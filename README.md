# UI/UX Design - Reverse Recipe Project

In CS 352: Intro to Usability Engineering (UI/UX Design) at the Oregon State University (OSU), I participated in a class wide group project where we first came up with project proposals as a team. 
My proposed idea of Reverse Recipe was accepted, and therefore, I was selected as project leader.
Reverse Recipe was born as a result of my friends goals to spend less money not only by reducing eating out less, but also efficiently using the already available ingredients in their pantry. 

Team members:

* Shannon Farazi
* Carter Fritsch
* Dylan Kieu
* Yu Chuan Tey
* Michael Ton

**Reverse Recipe** is an application that is designed to empower users to be able to shop, cook, and organize their kitchen in a revolutionary way. It aims to provide users with an accessible tool to 
help streamline and simplify their time spent on several aspects involved in the cooking process. The primary target demographic are adult-age individuals who have busy daily work lives and family 
obligations. The design of the interface has undergone revisions based on the research and analysis performed throughout development, which provided valuable insights on optimizing the design in order 
to deliver a high-fidelity interactive prototype and bring our vision to life.
